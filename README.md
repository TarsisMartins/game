a text-based rpg

It is 2006. I am playing a MUSH hosted on shoujoai.com. I discover that you can pretend to kiss other girls on the internet.

It is December 2016. I need money. I owe friends quite a bit, my warehouse work isn't cutting it, and my dreams are geting more expensive. I am taunted by the idea of a 5 bedroom home filled with artists. I decide there is only one proper response: dust off the old coding skills and seek employment. It feels like the siren song of a final heist, an amount of money I can only imagine gained by doing something I thought had been left behind. Getting employed isn't simple. At every turn, I am beset by questions about my "interests". Paying the bills is apparently not an interest, apparently. So I, like a computer, do exactly as I am told. I follow my interests. I make gay art.
