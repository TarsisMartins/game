# game
a text-based rpg

It is 2006. I am playing a MUSH hosted on shoujoai.com. Through this game, I discover that I am gay. 

It is 2016. I am working on a portfolio. People tell me to make a game. So I make a game that really more of an interactive poem. I make a one-player homage to the MUSH that helped me find myself so long ago.

At present, the Game works through a GameMap object that is really just creating and managing a graph of Room objects. Rooms are made of a simple description and a list of other connected rooms. Maps are integral to this because it becomes simple to code the key as the player command which pulls up the next action.

Planned Updates: Test error messages. Add more Rooms to Game Map. Add Items to Rooms. Format output to look neater: seprate lines, hard code line breaks.
