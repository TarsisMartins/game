#game

a text-based rpg

It is 2006. I am playing a MUSH hosted on shoujoai.com. Through this game, I discover that I am gay.

It is 2016. I am working on a portfolio. People tell me to make a game. So I make a game that really more of an interactive poem. I make a one-player homage to the MUSH that helped me find myself so long ago.
